# Silicon-leetcode
Silicon-leetcode is a collection of classical and advanced algorithms implemented in both software (C, C++) and hardware (Verilog, System Verilog). My goal is to bridge the gap between software level understanding and hardware level thinking to realize how algorithms work from high level code to digital logic.
